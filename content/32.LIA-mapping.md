## Little Ice Age Glacier Identification

Little Ice Age moraines were digitized primarily from 2014 LiDAR imagery ==cite== with a hillshade applied (QGIS).
These data were corroborated and augmented by ==year== National Agricultural Inventory Program (NAIP) aerial imagery and ==add data refs==. 
We follow the methods outlined in Martin-Mikle 2019 [@doi:10.1080/15230430.2019.1634443], delimiting the LIA location and size of glaciers from the presence of a terminal moraine, the presence of lateral moraines, and a size requirement of 0.01 km^2. 
==add note about trimlines, etc==

> The criteria used for identifying the former size and location of glaciers were (1) the presence of a terminal moraine; (2) the presence of lateral moraines; and (3) whether the identified glacier area exceeded 0.01 km2. A potential glacier was not omitted if it failed to meet both of the first two criteria (i.e., a LIA glacier that terminated at a cliff with well-defined lateral moraines but no discernible terminal moraine).
