    "abstract": "<jats:p>Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients—and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.</jats:p>",

However, direct measurements of ice thickness are laborious, not feasible everywhere and necessarily restricted to a small number of glaciers. In this paper, we present a method to estimate the ice-thickness distribution and the total ice volume of alpine glaciers. This method is based on glacier mass turnover and principles of ice-flow mechanics. The required input data are the glacier surface topography, the glacier outline and a set of borders delineating different ‘ice-flow catchments’. Three parameters describe the distribution of the ‘apparent mass balance’, which is defined as the difference between the glacier surface mass balance and the rate of ice-thickness change, and two parameters define the ice-flow dynamics. The method was developed and validated on four alpine glaciers located in Switzerland, for which the bedrock topography is partially known from radio-echo soundings. The ice thickness along 82 cross-profiles can be reproduced with an average deviation of about 25% between the calculated and the measured ice thickness. The cross-sectional areas differ by less than 20% on average. This shows the potential of the method for estimating the ice-thickness distribution of alpine glaciers without the use of direct measurements.</jats:p>",

The results are also directly applicable to the pumping of a non-Newtonian fluid down a pipe. There is assumed to be no slip of the ice on the channel surface. Certain results on the centre-line velocity in symmetrical channels may be derived purely from dimensional and symmetry principles. An analytical solution due to Dr. W. Chester is given for a semi-elliptic channel section which departs only slightly from a semi-circle. Contrary to a view sometimes held, the maximum shear stress at the ice surface in a parabolic channel and in some elliptical channels does not always occur at the edge. With the flow law, strain-rate proportional to (stress)<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, the velocity averaged across the ice surface, which is easily measured with a line of stakes, is close to the average velocity over the whole section for a wide range of parabolic sections; the hydrological importance of this result is that the discharge may be inferred without the need to measure the velocity at depth. Arguments are given to show that the result still holds when there is slipping on the bed and when the power in the flow law differs somewhat from 3, Depending on the amount of bed slip and the shape of the channel section, the kinematic wave velocity for a range of parabolic channels is between 2.0 and 2.3 times the centre-line velocity of the ice, and between 2.0 and 3.5 times the mean surface velocity of the ice.</jats:p>",

For past and potential climate scenarios, glacier changes for assumed mass-balance changes are calculated as step functions between steady-state conditions for time intervals that approximately correspond to the characteristic dynamic response time (a few decades) of the glaciers. In order to test the procedure, a pilot study was carried out in the European Alps where detailed glacier inventories had been compiled around the mid-1970s. Total glacier volume in the Alps is estimated at about 130 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> for the mid-1970s; strongly negative mass balances are likely to have caused a loss of about 10–20% of this total volume during the decade 1980–90.

The total loss of Alpine surface ice mass since 1850 can be estimated at about half the original value. An acceleration of this development, with annual mass losses of around 1 m a<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> or more as anticipated from IPCC scenario A for the coming century, could eliminate major parts of the presently existing Alpine ice volume within decades.</jats:p>",

A wealth of approaches has recently been presented for inferring ice thickness from characteristics of the surface. With the Ice Thickness Models Intercomparison eXperiment (ITMIX) we performed the first coordinated assessment quantifying individual model performance. A set of 17 different models showed that individual ice thickness estimates can differ considerably – locally by a spread comparable to the observed thickness. Averaging the results of multiple models, however, significantly improved the results: on average over the 21 considered test cases, comparison against direct ice thickness measurements revealed deviations on the order of 10 ± 24 % of the mean ice thickness (1σ estimate). Models relying on multiple data sets – such as surface ice velocity fields, surface mass balance, or rates of ice thickness change – showed high sensitivity to input data quality. Together with the requirement of being able to handle large regions in an automated fashion, the capacity of better accounting for uncertainties in the input data will be a key for an improved next generation of ice thickness estimation approaches.\n                    </jats:p>",

Due to its large glacier coverage, such estimates are of particular interest for the Himalayan–Karakoram (HK) region. In this study, different existing methodologies are used to estimate the ice reserves: three area–volume relations, one slope-dependent volume estimation method, and two ice-thickness distribution models are applied to a recent, detailed, and complete glacier inventory of the HK region, spanning over the period 2000–2010 and revealing an ice coverage of 40 775 km2. An uncertainty and sensitivity assessment is performed to investigate the influence of the observed glacier area and important model parameters on the resulting total ice volume. Results of the two ice-thickness distribution models are validated with local ice-thickness measurements at six glaciers. The resulting ice volumes for the entire HK region range from 2955 to 4737 km3, depending on the approach. This range is lower than most previous estimates. Results from the ice thickness distribution models and the slope-dependent thickness estimations agree well with measured local ice thicknesses. However, total volume estimates from area-related relations are larger than those from other approaches. The study provides evidence on the significant effect of the selected method on results and underlines the importance of a careful and critical evaluation.</jats:p>",
