## Little Ice Age Glacier Identification

LIA moraines were digitized primarily from 2014 LiDAR imagery (CITE) with a hillshade applied (QGIS). 
These data were corroborated and augmented by ==year== National Agricultural Inventory Program (NAIP) aerial imagery and ==add data refs==. 
Little Ice Age moraines are found far upvalley of dated moraines from the Last Glacial Maximum  [@doi:10.1016/j.quascirev.2007.12.005]. 
LGM deglaciation began around 13.8ka and finished by 11.5ka according to lake sediment records [@doi:10.1016/j.quascirev.2016.02.024]. 
No cosmogenic dating of LIA moraines exist in the literature. 
We initially followed the methods outlined in Martin-Mikle 2019 [@doi:10.1080/15230430.2019.1634443], delimiting the LIA location and size of glaciers from the presence of a terminal moraine, the presence of lateral moraines, and a size requirement of 0.01 km^2. 
However, not all of the 11 named glaciers fit this criteria; these are outlined in light red in Figure 1. Because of their relevance to park history and visitation, they are included here but with the caveat that their size may limit the relevance of our analysis.
Trimelines were only visible for... We estimated minimum and maximum extent using the GlaRe [@doi:10/f827s2] package in ArcGIS Pro to reconstruct ice extent in the LIA.

==add note about trimlines, etc==

> The criteria used for identifying the former size and location of glaciers were (1) the presence of a terminal moraine; (2) the presence of lateral moraines; and (3) whether the identified glacier area exceeded 0.01 km2. A potential glacier was not omitted if it failed to meet both of the first two criteria (i.e., a LIA glacier that terminated at a cliff with well-defined lateral moraines but no discernible terminal moraine).
