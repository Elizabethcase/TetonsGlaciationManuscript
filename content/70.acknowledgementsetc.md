## Acknowledgements
This work wouldn't have happened without Americorp's Scientist-in-Parks program, which provided funding for Elizabeth Case to work in the Grand Teton National Park in the summer of 2021. She was funded during the development of this manuscript on grant number [XXX]. Many thanks to Aazia Taylor, Justin Culman, and Joey Nadeau, who helped with the fieldwork and were overall a delight to work with. Carly Cody and Joerg Schaefer advised on methods used for moraine and trimline identification.
