## Little Ice Age Glacial Geology

Little Ice Age (LIA) moraines were digitized primarily from 1m resolution LiDAR imagery (CITE, 2014) with a hillshade applied (QGIS), and aided by NAIP imagery from 2019 (CITE) and a combined imagery product from Google. 
No LIA moraines have been dated in the park to our knowledge; however, there is little ambiguity between LIA and LGM moraines: LIA moraines are found far upvalley of dated moraines from the Last Glacial Maximum  [@doi:10.1016/j.quascirev.2007.12.005]. 
In the Teton Range, LGM deglaciation began around 13.8ka and finished by 11.5ka according to lake sediment records [@doi:10.1016/j.quascirev.2016.02.024].

We initially followed the methods outlined in Martin-Mikle 2019 [@doi:10.1080/15230430.2019.1634443], delimiting the LIA location and size of glaciers from the presence of a terminal moraine, the presence of lateral moraines, and a size requirement of 0.01 km^2, following previous research (e.g. [@doi:10.1080/15230430.2019.1634443]). 
However, not all of the 11 named glaciers fit this criteria; these are outlined in light red in Figure 1. Because of their relevance to park history and visitation, they are included here but with the caveat that their size may limit the relevance of our analysis.

The terminal moraines of Teton Glacier, Schoolroom Glacier, and West Triple are classic crested moraines. 
Others, like Peterson, Teepe, Falling Ice, and Middle Teton, are much less distinct and often untraceable, due to washout, steep slopes, and other indistinct processes. 


Peterson's terminal moraine seems to have been almost completely washed away.

==add note about trimlines, etc==

> The criteria used for identifying the former size and location of glaciers were (1) the presence of a terminal moraine; (2) the presence of lateral moraines; and (3) whether the identified glacier area exceeded 0.01 km2. A potential glacier was not omitted if it failed to meet both of the first two criteria (i.e., a LIA glacier that terminated at a cliff with well-defined lateral moraines but no discernible terminal moraine).
