## Methods

This paper combines remotely sensed, in situ, and modeled data and outputs to comprehensively examine the changes in Teton glaciation since the Little Ice Age.
LIA moraines and trimlines provide an estimate of LIA ice volume and extent in Section 2.1. 
Using aerial imagery, we produce a timeseries of aerial change between 1950-2021 as outlined in Section 2.2, and generate digital elevation models to estimate ice volume loss across seven decades in Section 2.3. 
Among other work, _in-situ_ data collection has generated high resolution surface elevation changes of Middle Teton Glacier over the last seven years, providing a benchmark for future glacier work, discussed in Section 2.4. 
Finally, a simple alpine glacier model allows us to estimate past and current ice volume in the landscape, and compare modeled changes to observed changes throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.
