## Ice-slab model to generate approximate ice thicknesses

Following Florentine et al. we use a simple slab model to estimate the ice thickness. 

This relationship assumes that the driving and yield stress are equal. 
If this is true, ice surfaces with low surface angles must have large driving stresses, e.g. be very thick. 
But once a glacier thins substantially and stops flowing, which occurs near the terminus of many Teton glaciers - this relationship fails to hold. 
While this model is used widely as a simple tool for reconstructing/estimating ice thickness for alpine glaciers, this caveat is an important one. As alpine glaciers continue to thin, this issue will only become more pronounced.
