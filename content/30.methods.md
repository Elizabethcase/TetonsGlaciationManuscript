## Methods

This paper combines remotely sensed, in situ, and modeled data and outputs to comprehensively examine the changes in Teton glaciation since the Little Ice Age.
LIA moraines and trimlines provide an estimate of LIA ice volume and extent. 
Aerial and satellite imagery produce a timeseries of aerial change between 1950-2021, and are used to generate digital elevation models to estimate ice volume loss across seven decades. 
Among other work,_in-situ_ data collection has generated high resolution surface elevation changes of Middle Teton Glacier over the last seven years, providing a benchmark for future glacier work. 
Finally, two simple models (ice slab, VOLTA) allow us to estimate past and current ice volume in the landscape.
