## Introduction.{page_break_before}

The Teton Range's iconic landscape of jagged peaks and classic U-shaped valleys has been carved out of stone by glaciers over many thousands of years.
The range is the defining feature of Grand Teton National Park, which lies just south of Yellowstone in the north-western corner of Wyoming. 
This study investigates the de-glaciation of the 11 named glaciers in the park from the Little Ice Age to 2021.

1. Little Ice Age
While most of the sculptural work was completed over the last two ice ages ==cite==, the Little Ice Age (1300-1850), a period of cooling in the northern hemisphere, left its mark on the landscape. 
Terminal and lateral moraines delineate the park's remaining glaciers, which subsist on and in north and east facing walls and valleys scattered throughout the park.
