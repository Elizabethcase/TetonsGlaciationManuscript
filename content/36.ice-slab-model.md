## Ice-slab model to generate approximate ice thicknesses

Following Nye (1965) and Florentine et al. (2019), we use a simple slab model to estimate the ice thickness,

$$ h = \frac{\tau}{f \rho g sin\alpha}, $$
where $h$ is the thickness of the glacier, $\tau$ is the basal shear stress, $f$ is a shape factor [@doi:10.3189/S0022143000018670], $\rho$ is the density of ice (917 kg m$^{-2}$), and $\alpha$ is the surface slope of the glacier. 

This relationship assumes that the driving and yield stress scale according to the shape factor (are equal if $f$=1). 
If this is true, ice surfaces with low surface angles must have large driving stresses, e.g. be very thick. 
But once a glacier thins substantially and stops flowing, which occurs near the terminus of many Teton glaciers - this relationship fails to hold. 
This is a known problem; most approaches get around this issue by setting a minimum slope and ignoring areas of ice that exists below it.
While this model is used widely as a simple tool for estimating the ice thickness of alpine glaciers [@doi:10.5194/tc-11-949-2017], this caveat is an important one. 
As alpine glaciers continue to thin, this issue will only become more pronounced. 

This model was extended to account for simplified topography [@doi:10.3189/S0022143000018670], side drag [@doi:10.1029/2011JF002104], and variable basal shear stresses [@doi:10.3189/S0260305500015834].
