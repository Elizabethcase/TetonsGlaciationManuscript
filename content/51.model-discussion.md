We use a simple slab model to estimate glacier thickness, using Nye's 1952 formulation. Since the 1950s, this shear-stress-based model has been expanded to include variable basal shear stress, valley-wall drag, a shape factor, and so on. 

Instead of absolute ice thickness estimates, we aim to investigate change in ice thickness. 
Lacking surface mass balance measurements (few measurements taken, except, as outlined above, between 2016 and the present day), surface velocity (these glaciers are, in general, too small for most satellite data to be used to track surface features, so the only measured velocity data is from ablation stakes left on Middle Teton Glacier between 2019 and the present day), and weather data or reanalysis (sparse measurements in the Tetons likely do not reflect the surface mass additions of avalanching and wind-blown snow), we are left with glacial outlines and DEMs (LiDAR and HSFM, see Sections XX and XX respectively) as the only source of information for our models. 
The simplest approach to generating ice thickness estimates of alpine glaciers is an area-scaling approach (see Bahr 2015 for a review). 
With digital elevation models from HSFM and LiDAR, we can go further with information about surface slope and the surrounding topography.
In Nye 1952, we obtain the approach used in this paper, which assumes a perfectly plastic model with no topographical influence.
Farinotti et al. (2017) showed in their intercomparison project that the inclusion of more data (e.g. surface velocities, SMB measurements) did not, on average, improve modeled glacier thickness estimates. 
The models that performed the best and only used OL and DEM information included Farinotti et al. 2009 (the ITEM model), Huss and Farinotti 2014 (HF-model), Linsbauer et al. (2014), and Frey et al. (2014), two mass-conserving-based and two shear-stress-based approaches respectively. 
Huss and Farinotti (2014) and Frey et al. (2014) extend their counterparts without fundamentally changing the physics, so we considered these two possible approaches.
