The Teton Range in northwest Wyoming is home to 11 named glaciers and a handful? dozens? of permanent snow and icefields. About forty miles long and ten miles across, the mountain range is an (ecological? geological?) continuation of the Rockies that lies northwest of the Wind River Range within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem 

Since the end of the Little Ice Age (~1850-1870) CITE, glaciers in this range have retreated or disappeared entirely. Geologic remnants of these glaciers, in the form of moraines and trimlines, can be mapped throughout the park. The surviving glaciers have primarily east- and north-facing aspects, and are, for the most part, topographically protected by large rock walls. These walls provide both steep surfaces for snow to accumulate and avalanche from, onto the glacier surface, and protect the glacier from wind scouring. 

While nearby glaciers have been documented and studied (CITE- GNP, Wind River, Rockies), the Teton range glaciers have been generally overlooked. This work aims to qualitatively and quantitatively record glacial change in the Tetons over the last 150-170 years, from the end of the LIA to 2021.
